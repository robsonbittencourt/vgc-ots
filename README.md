# vgc-ots

This extension is a fork of [OpenTeamsheetGraphic](https://github.com/RobinsonCzajkowski/OpenTeamsheetGraphic), an excellent idea by @RobinsonCzajkowski.

The main purpose of this fork is to display the Open Team Sheet above the chat log in a fixed manner, making the OTS panel constantly visible.

This version also features several differences from the original:

- The code has been rewritten to improve maintainability.
- Visual improvements have been implemented.
- All sprites are now working.
- The original OTS display is replaced by this extension.
